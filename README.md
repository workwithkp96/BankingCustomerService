**Banking Customer Service Application**
This project is a Banking Customer Service application built using Java Spring Boot 3+ and Spring Security 6+. It manages customer and bank employee authentication, 
account management, transaction details, and other banking features like credit and debit card handling and loan management.

**Features**
**1. User Authentication & Authorization:**
  JWT-based authentication: Users log in using a userId and password, and a JWT token is generated and returned in the response header after successful login.
  Role-based authorization: Users can have roles such as CUSTOMER, ADMIN, or USER, which are stored in the database. Customers can only access their own data if they have the CUSTOMER role.
**2. Account Management:**
  Customers can manage and view the different types of bank accounts they hold:
  Savings Accounts
  Current Accounts
  Fixed Deposit Accounts
  Recurring Deposit Accounts
  A customer can hold multiple accounts of the same or different types.
**3. Transactions:**
  View transaction history for Savings and Current accounts.
  Each transaction contains details such as:
  Transaction ID
  Description
  Amount
  Credit/Debit
  Timestamp
  The system supports querying transactions made from the customerâ€™s accounts.
**4. Fixed Deposit and Recurring Deposit:**
  For Fixed Deposit accounts, customers can view:
  Amount invested
  Maturity date
  Interest rate
  Final amount after maturity
  For Recurring Deposit accounts, customers can view:
  Monthly investment
  Interest rate
  Maturity date
  Next cycle date
  Last investment date
  Final matured amount
**5. Credit and Debit Card Management:**
  Customers can manage both credit and debit cards they hold.
  For Debit Cards:
  Customers can see the linked account, card number, validity, and balance limits.
  For Credit Cards:

  Support for different types of credit and debit cards.
**6. Loan Management:**
  Customers can manage their loans, with the system supporting different types of loans:

  Home Loan
  Car Loan
  Bike Loan
  Customers can view details for each loan such as:
  Loan amount
  Interest rate
  Type of loan
